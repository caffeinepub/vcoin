  "summary": "The diff adds visible startup/loading and error fallback UIs (StartupGate, StartupStatusScreen, AppErrorBoundary/AppErrorFallback) and improves base-path-safe asset URL generation via assetUrl(). However, the HTML entry point still hardcodes root-relative asset and script URLs, which is not base-path safe for deployed previews hosted under a subpath.",
  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "id": "REQ-23",
      "requirement": "Make the app deployment/base-path safe so route matching and static assets load correctly when hosted under a non-root subpath, including fixing base-URL handling in the HTML entry point.",
      "reason": "The modified HTML entry still uses root-relative URLs for the favicon and the main script (leading '/'), which will break when the app is served from a non-root subpath (e.g., /preview/...); the diff does not show these being changed to use a base-aware path (e.g., relative URLs or Vite BASE_URL).",
