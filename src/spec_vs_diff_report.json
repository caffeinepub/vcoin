  "summary": "REQ-17 is largely addressed by moving routed rendering into the root route via <Outlet /> and removing any RouterProvider usage from the root route component. REQ-18’s fallback UI and boundary components were added, but the diff summary does not conclusively show the error boundary being mounted at the application root (wrapping the router render) due to App.tsx truncation.",

      "id": "REQ-17",
      "requirement": "Render RouterProvider only once in App (and not nested) to avoid blank screen/runtime errors.",
      "reason": "The shown portion of frontend/src/App.tsx fixes the root route to render <Outlet />, but the file is truncated before the actual App component render where RouterProvider placement/count would be verified. The diff summary does not show the final JSX to confirm RouterProvider is rendered exactly once.",

      "id": "REQ-18",
      "requirement": "Add an application-level user-friendly error fallback during app initialization/render so users do not see a blank screen.",
      "reason": "An AppErrorBoundary and fallback screen were added, but the diff summary does not show that AppErrorBoundary is actually used to wrap the app’s initialization/render tree (e.g., wrapping RouterProvider in App). App.tsx is truncated before the render/return where this would be confirmed.",
